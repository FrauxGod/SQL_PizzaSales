# SQL_PizzaSales
This SQL project focuses on a database schema tailored for a pizza shop, helping to track and analyze sales data. The database includes four main tables: order_details, pizzas, orders, and pizza_types. Each table stores essential business information, covering everything from customer orders to the different pizza varieties available.
